# Dependancies
Install truffle:
```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

Install ganache(Truffle's version of TestRPC):
```bash
npm install -g ganache-cli
```


# Usage
To build and deploy on local ganache test network:
```bash
chmod +x ./build.sh
./build.sh
```

If you encounter `The contract code couldn't be stored, please check your gas amount`, just run `./build.sh` again. This error occurs because we can't deploy abstract contracts.
